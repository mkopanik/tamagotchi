## Tamagotchi minigame 
Project to pass one of coding subjects during math studies.Before ChatGPT era we created from scratch really funny app with some logic in it. Of course it's not much not optimal etc., etc. But before coding this little app we had absolutely 0 knowledge about Java and object programming 
so for me it was really funny and satysfing project.
